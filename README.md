# Traveling Salesman Problem – Spaceship Signal Routing

This project explores a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in a 3D space setting, where an alpha spaceship must transmit a signal to a set of other ships located at unique (x, y, z) coordinates and return to its origin. The signal must visit every spaceship exactly once, and each leg of the route is based on the Euclidean distance between ships. The goal is to determine the shortest possible route that starts and ends at the alpha ship. The notebook implements and analyzes three approaches: Brute Force, Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp), and Greedy Heuristic. The brute force method evaluates all (n−1)! route permutations and computes total distances, resulting in O(n × (n−1)!) time and O(n) space complexity. The dynamic programming solution builds a state table using bitmasking and minimizes subproblem overlap, achieving O(n² × 2ⁿ) time and space complexity. The greedy method approximates the solution by selecting the nearest unvisited spaceship at each step, completing the route in O(n²) time and O(n) space. All methods are compared in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Brute Force and Dynamic Programming yield optimal results for small and medium input sizes, respectively, while the Greedy method provides a fast, near-optimal route for larger datasets. The notebook includes implementation code, test cases, and performance analysis for each algorithm.
